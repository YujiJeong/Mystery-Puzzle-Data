# Mystery-Puzzle-Data
Exploratory data analysis with Python Woohoo! I clean and manipulate this mystery data (I'm not given any information on the data prior to the analysis!) with Pythonâ€™s Pandas library. I also visualize data with matplotlib.

See **'solving_puzzle_data.ipynb'** to see the main exploratory data analysis.'solving_puzzle_data.ipynb' analyzes with 'puzzle.csv' and 'global-airports.geojson'

See **'top50_airports.ipynb'** for additional exploratory data analysis. 'top50_airports.ipynb' analyzes with 'puzzle.csv', 'global-airports.geojson' **and** 'largest-global-airports-by-passenger-traffic-1.xls'

**'puzzle.csv'** is the mystery data that I obtained from Hopper

**'global-airports.geojson'** contains the coordinates and names (IATA) of over 6000 airports around the world

**'largest-global-airports-by-passenger-traffic-1.xls'** contains the names (IATA) of the top 50 most visited airports in the world
